Description: This app compares the goodness of fitting with Lognormal and
    Gamma distribution. It provides the AIC of maximum likelihood
    estimation of both distributions from package ‘fitdistrplus’ as well
    Shaprio-Wilk statistics and P value from package ‘EnvStats’. Besides,
    the app also shows the cumulative probability function (CDF) and Q-Q
    plot fitting. Final decision about the data follow Lognormal or Gamma
    depends on above computing results. Generally, smaller AIC, larger P
    value, and closer line to the scatter in CDF/Q-Q plot mean the more
    likely the data follow that distribution.
